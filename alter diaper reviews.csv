1,Amer,5,Nice,25 April 2025,"Pattern Name: PantsSize: Medium- Explorer
After using Teddy brand, Huggies brand diapers switched to Alter seeing the positive reviews and as it's bamboo made. Some days the diaper seems good. But whenever baby is sleeping on one side and if baby is little fussy she keeps on feeding for long time in side position, then the diaper starts leaking and wets whole dress. So far have noticed leakage twice while using these diapers. Also I'm using for night time so if anyone uses during daytime and based on baby activities it might leak for sure.",Amazon,12am,English,Amazon Reviews
1,Lucky,5,"Soft, Comfortable, and Rash-Free Diapers for My Baby",18 February 2025,"’ve been using these diapers for my baby, and I couldn’t be happier with the results! The organic bamboo material is incredibly soft and gentle on my baby’s skin, and I noticed there’s no irritation or redness, even after long hours of use. The diapers are super absorbent and keep my baby dry through the night without any leaks, which is a huge relief!

The pant-style design makes it easy to put on and take off, and the wetness indicator is a handy feature, letting me know when it’s time for a change. I also appreciate that they are rash-free, which is very important for my baby’s delicate skin.

The fit is perfect for my baby (M size, 9-14kg), and the diapers don’t feel bulky or uncomfortable. They stay snug and secure, so I don’t have to worry about leaks or shifting during playtime.

I highly recommend these diapers for parents looking for a high-quality, natural, and comfortable option for their babies. Plus, the eco-friendly bamboo material is a big win!

1,swathi surendran,1,Dont go by ratings,11 January 2025,"I used Alter Diapers for a month, hoping they would live up to the glowing reviews, but I am extremely disappointed. While the diapers are soft to touch, their size is way too small for the mentioned age/weight range, making them uncomfortable for the baby.

The biggest letdown is their absorbency. Despite claims of staying dry, these diapers become wet very quickly compared to other premium yet cheaper options. This results in frequent changes, which is neither economical nor convenient.

I truly regret trusting the ratings and investing in these diapers. After a month of use, I wouldn’t recommend them to anyone looking for comfort, quality and value.

It can be used in the night time without the need to change diapers in between. There is no leakage and pretty safe to use considering the usage of natural products. But it's very costly. One diaper is almost 45-50rs which is not affordable by many. I use it only for my little one only during the night times or when going for a long car trip or train trip.

12,Ananya,2,The quality and absorbency of diapers have been reduced.,01 October 2022,"I have been purchasing ""Allter"" diapers for my baby. Till last year i.e. December 2021, the quantity and absorbency of these diapers were at par any other brand in this segment. But since March 2022, I am seeing the issues with the diaper. They are: 1) Earlier these diapers had more bamboo pulp and as a result were more thicker and lasted 7+ hours easily (throughout the night) without any wetness on the top sheet. But now the diapers are thin and hardly last 2 hours. The worst part is crumbled bamboo pulp that you get to see at the time of diaper change. The pulp completely turns into crumbled blob (many pieces). 2) Allter has smartly kept the same price even after an year but reduced the quality so much that the price per diaper now seems way more higher than the other brands. One packet of diaper hardly lasts 5-6 days.

Allter has been the best find with it’s fragrance free bamboo core. How I wish we could have known about them 2 years ago when, our baby was born.

Have so far ordered bundles via amazon as well as on their website. The delivery was prompt in both cases and customer care was seamless.

14,Praky,1,Unsuitable for a newborn,18 April 2023,"Pattern Name: TapeSize: New Born- Feet
These diapers are not rash-free. Infact my newborn had quite a few rashes due to these diapers. The scratchy surface on which you tape the diaper up from both sides is very hard and scratches against the newborns sensitive tummy causing rashes. You can compare how soft the Pampers taped diapers for newborn are, for example. Even the taping of your diaper is not strong, although it does not come off, it does make sound when baby moves their legs in a certain way.

Overall, they should learn from other well established brands. Bamboo fibre is all good but you need to think about other parts of the diaper as well.

These days there are so many new companies companies coming up every day and all are making tall claims which do not hold true.

14,Unknown,2,Disappointed,13 September 2020,"Pattern Name: TapeSize: New Born- Feet
The main reason for choosing and buying these diapers were the fact that it was environmentally friendly. Was extremely disappointed to find gel inside it which isn't bio-degradable. Not worth paying extra money when it's just like other diapers with only a bamboo outer.

This diaper is honestly the best i have ever used for my baby. Best part was it being derived from 100% natural source, so my baby did not get rashes due to the chemicals in other brands. Rest the cute packaging looks good to see too!
